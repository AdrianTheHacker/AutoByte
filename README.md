## Tech Bro Stuff ü§ñ
| Area | Name |
| --------- | ---- |
| Frontend/Routing üñ•Ô∏è| NextJS with Tailwind and Typescript |
| Component Library üß© | DaisyUI |
| DatabaseüóÑÔ∏è | Firebase - Firestore Database |
| UI Design üé® | Canva |

I'd like the mention though that I don't use Typescript too strict. Usually, I only add types to the codebase to assist with state management and accessing data from database.
